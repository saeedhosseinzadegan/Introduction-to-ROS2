# Turtle Pose Plotter and Random Target Generator
#
# This node subscribes to /turtle1/pose of type turtlesim/msg/Pose
# and visualizes the turtle position on a 10x10 grid using matplotlib. A 1x1
# target square is randomly generated. When the turtle reaches the square,
# a new target is generated and displayed. The node provides a real-time visual
# representation of the turtle navigating towards successive random targets.

        #    the turtle's current position and orientation. Use the 
        #    'Pose' message type from 'turtlesim.msg'. The callback function
        #    that processes incoming messages should be named 'pose_callback'.
        #
        # 2. Create a timer that periodically updates the plot to reflect
        #    the turtle's current position and the target square. The timer
        #    should call the 'update_plot' function at a fixed interval.
        #
        # Ensure that both the subscriber and timer are correctly initialized
        # within the node so the plot updates dynamically as the turtle moves.
